# Get started

This project consists 2 parts, server and client.

The server side was built by `json-server`, that helps create a group of APIs very quick, in just 30 secs.
The client side was build with React. It also used a trendy css frame work, `styled-components`. You might love it.

So, to get started, you need to install all the dependencies first, by running the command `npm install`, then running the following commands in different thread.

1. `npm run server`

2. `npm run client`

The main app will run in port 3000 by default, whereas the APIs will be served in 3001. Now you can open your browser and enter this URL http://localhost:3000 to access project `Kamereo Tamboon`.

Btw, you can run `npm run test`, to test your application.
